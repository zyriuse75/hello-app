# Hello-app

I used traefik as IngressController because it responds to all requests i guess I could have tried with sidecar.


**aim**:
 - [x] reverse proxy                                                      
 - [x] load-balancer should support multiple load-balancing strategies    
 - [x] HTTP 1.1         
 - [x] create helm package 
 - [ ] monitoring   
 
**optional**
 - [ ] round-robin strategy for the load-balancer 
 - [x] memory-cache 
 - [ ] K8s operator 

## Achievement

To carry out the project I went through the servers provided by cloudguru **(cloud certification & training courses)**.

I don't have a graphical user interface so I wondered what the client might need ?

So I have implemented 

- [x] liveness & readiness
- [x] canary deployment
- [x] Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
- [x] Container Security Content
 

```bash
pip install foobar
```
